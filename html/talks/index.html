<h2>Talks about HTTP::Proxy</h2>

<h3>YAPC::Europe 2004, Belfast, Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>This time, I had slides ready, but the demonstration needed a network
access. I spend most of my pre-talk time rushing around looking for
network instead of calming down and concentrating on what I would say.
Network worked the second I started my talk, which shows I shouldn't
have worried. I hope the audience liked it.

<h3>Les journées Perl 2004, Paris, France</h3>
<p>I gave a <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/2004/talk/1">40
minute talk</a>, with only 3 slides, mostly because I was
too busy organising the conference to prepare the slides. The show was
spend showing the code and a proxy working.</p>
