<h2>Talks about HTTP::Proxy</h2>

<h3>YAPC::Europe 2005, Braga, Portugal</h3>
<p>I plan to have new slides for this conference. <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h3>Les journées Perl 2005, Marseille, France</h3>
<p>Once again, I had no slides ready. So I did the same talk
as for YAPC::Europe 2004.</p>

<h3>YAPC::Europe 2004, Belfast, Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>This time, I had slides ready, but the demonstration needed a network
access. I spent most of my pre-talk time rushing around looking for
network instead of calming down and concentrating on what I would say.
Network worked the second I started my talk, which shows I shouldn't
have worried.
</p>
<p>I hope the audience liked my <a href="ye2004/">YAPC::Europe 2004
slides</a>.</p>

<h3>Les journées Perl 2004, Paris, France</h3>
<p>I gave a <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/2004/talk/1">40
minute talk</a>, with only 3 slides, mostly because I was
too busy organising the conference to prepare the slides. The show was
spend showing the code and a proxy at work.</p>
