TODO

Here are all the features I plan to add to HTTP::Proxy

 - Browsing recording in a tree-like structure (thanks to Referer:)
 - Control the proxy via specific URIs
   (e.g. http://proxy/start_recording)
 - insert callbacks in the various stages of the process
 - become a POE component
 - remove forking
 - proxy a https site
   http://proxy-https/www.secure.com:80/index.html
 - commands are prefixed by proxy-xxx
   * proxy-status => some debug information
   * proxy-config => live config management (not for forked stuff)

Useful documentation
